    <div class="w3-container">
      <p style="font-size:140%;">I enrol preschool, <i>Tabika Kemas</i> which is located near my house. 
        I went to preschool only by walking and of course my mother or sometimes sister sent me there.
        I was a crybaby and cannot go to preschool by myself. I usually cry while holding the preschool gate while my mom leave me.
        Thinking about it back, I was a burden to my mother at that time as I have other siblings at home.</p>

        <p style="font-size:140%;">During my primary school, I enrol <b>both</b> SK and SRA(agama). This means that I have 2 session of school. 
        One is sekolah kebangsaan and the other one is sekolah agama. It is not that hectic as children have more energy. The SRA school is basically beside my house, so going to school is not a problem.
        The SK school is a bit far than the SRA and preschool, but walking is not really tiring. During grade 1 till 3, I remember wailing from school all the way home for petty reason. 
        But I become more mature as I was moving on to grade 4. My UPSR result is <b>4A 1B</b> and PSRA result is <b>Jaid Jiddan</b> which is the second best grade.</p>

          <p style="font-size:140%;">SMK Taman Selayang is my secondary school. There are many things that I gain in this scool.
          I was enrolling the KAA class which is <q>Kelas Aliran Agama</q>. This class only have a few more subject in it. From form 1 till 3 in KAA class
          and in form 4 & 5 I was put in Neptune class that focuses on drawing engineering. I was really glad to be put in that class as I have interest in that subject.</p>

      <div class="w3-container">
        <p style="font-size:140%;">I enroll as a diploma student in Information Management. It can be said that I change my interest from engineering to mangement.
        This is because I was a bit lost in choosing what course in university but luckily I pick this course as there many new knowledge I gain. It is really out of my comfort zone.</p>

        <p style="font-size:140%;">The university that I went to is UiTM Cawangan Negeri Sembilan Kampus Rembau which is near my hometown. I was really lucky as my home is in Selangor and 
          there are public transport to go there.
